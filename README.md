# ASSEMPLY MIPS examples and codes

# Context 
During the lab of Architecture of Computer we wrote a lot of assembly code.

I thought about saving and organising it in a repository, for personal use.

After the classes ended I realised the plethora of code that I had in the repository.

So me and Efi(@effieep) decided to organize the code and post it, in order to:

* Help any student of DIT,University Of Athens with their lab. 
* Provide some ready to use code for someone learning assembly.

# Contents 
## lab-exercises
The code for all the exercises we completed in the lab.

## exams 
All the exam material of our and previous years solved.

## useful-code
Some useful TOOLS and code as template and ready to use functions. These files, practically used as a library, provided a tool-box that allowed as to focus on higher-level problems, rather than writing evey lin eby hand

# Contribution - Efi Papafili 
The contribution of Efi in the repository and the lab has been really game-changing!
