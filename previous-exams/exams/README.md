### Description for each exercise

- **CommonCharsin2Strings.s**

Write a program in assembly MIPS that takes two strings of 10 characters from the user and prints for each character of the first string how many times appears in the second string. In addition, the program prints the position of the character in the string each time.

- **MultOfVectorsFloat.s**

Write a program in assembly MIPS that has two vectors with 10 elements, who are saved in the data segment and after printing them, calculates and prints their result. 
Example: [1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0] * [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1] = 20 

- **SecondDegreeEquationFloat.s**

Write a program in assembly MIPS that takes the a, b, c of the ax^2 + bx + c = 0 as floating point numbers and prints the solution/s or that it has not any solutions based on the Î” = b^2 - 4ac.
